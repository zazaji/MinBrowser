# MinBrowser

## Content

This is a mini browser that opens multiple windows, fixed to the right side of the screen. You can customize your own page and use it as an app.

It works with my other app.For example, I use google gemini , start a node service locally, and then add a window in this app, to realize anytime anywhere access to chatgpt-like services.
